Hello there,

Before running the code:
To run the code make sure you have an up to date version of OpenCL along with the correct build properties.

First open the "Parallel Programming Assignment.sln" file which should launch to Visual Studio.
Then press F5 to begin debugging which should launch you to the simple menu where you can use the numbers to select the OpenCL compatible device.
Following that, enter the corresponding number with the option that you would like to see.
